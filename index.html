        Some woman smoke during pregnancy but may be unaware of the implications on them and their offspring. This article aims to highlight the consequences intaking certain toxins such as nitrosamines and benzene and 
        what effect they have on the body. It also shows the correlation between low birth weights and cigarettes smoke by using a study done on mice to explore this idea. Parental smoking can also be just as hazardous 
        as it exposes the mother to second hand exposure which is still a risk. Scientists discourage smoking during pregnancy, but nicotine replacement therapy is a way to help pregnant woman during the 9-month period 
        as nicotine is a highly addictive substance.</p>

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
   <p class="ex1">
    <pre>
      Cigarettes have been around since the late 1800’s and have been implemented as a necessity into many people’s daily lives. Around 1.3 billion of the population smoke cigarettes worldwide. However, the implications
      of smoking have been a main topic of conversation throughout the years, especially their effect on pregnancy. The intake of certain carcinogens has been linked to the development of many cardiovascular diseases 
      while also leading to complications on infancy and health in the long term.

    Carcinogens in cigarettes and their effect on health (heading) 
    Cigarette smoking has contributed to the development of health problems and premature deaths and is considered a major risk for the development of cancer, cardiovascular diseases and fetal developmental
    abnormalities ([19] (CDC, 2020)) due to the carcinogens in them. Carcinogens are substances that tend to cause cancer ([20] (Hutter, 2023)) They directly harm the body, and the impact increases the more the
    average person smokes. Exposure to carcinogens such as nitrosamines is due to the continual intake of tobacco. The levels of tobacco specific nitrosamines (NNN and NNK) depend on how it is prepared ([5] (Yalcin
    and de la Monte, 2016)). Higher levels are found in certain types and strains of tobacco leaf ([11] (RIVM, 2018)) . Tobacco-specific nitrosamines are broken down by enzymes causing damage to DNA and ([11] 
    (RIVM, 2018)) tissue injury causing malignant transformations. Without treatment, this can lead to the development of cancer predominantly in the lungs or airways and it is shown to lead to cancer in foetus. 
    Another potent carcinogen in cigarettes is benzene. Benzene causes harmful effects on bone marrow and a decrease in red blood cells ([12] (CDC, 2018)). The department of Health and Human Services has determined 
    that benzene is a factor that contributes to the development of cancer. Some women who breathed high levels of benzene were shown to have irregular periods however it is unknown whether this exposure affects their
    fertility ([12] (CDC, 2018)). 


    Complications in pregnancy (heading)
    Pregnant woman who smoke are at increased risk of development of myocardial infarction (heart attack) as it is one of the causes ([1] (Nanda, Nelson-Piercy and Mackillop, 2012) ) of premature death and is 
    detrimental to both mother and baby. Female smokers are reported to have 2-fold increased risk and also doing this while taking oral contraceptives increases risk by 7 to 100-fold which is very high risk category.
    ([21] (James, A.H., Jamison, M.G., Biswas, M.S., Brancazio, L.R., Swamy, G.K. and Myers, E.R.) ) Smoking damages the heart and blood vessels with substances such as nicotine, carbon monoxide and tar all contributing
    to this; they act by replacing the oxygen in your blood and coating your lungs like soot in a chimney, which cuts off oxygen supply making it hard to breathe ([2] (Department of Health, 2022)). Low blood supply to 
    the embryo causes a decrease in mental development also affecting the growth of new cells in the baby ([3] (Moore and Persaud, 1998, p.185)). Maternal smoking is also known to be one of the main causes of growth 
    retardation ([3]  (Moore and Persaud, 1998, p.185) ). This is when a baby in the womb does not grow as expected and does not follow the progression expected at the stage of the mother’s pregnancy ([7] (Hirsch, 2020)).
    This leads to the baby being physically underdeveloped. Aswell as that, low birth weight is the chief reason for premature infant death and directly correlates to maternal and paternal smoking, as well as the chance 
    of obtaining conotruncal heart defects and limb deficiencies ([3]  (Moore and Persaud, 1998, p.185) ) . Conotruncal heart defects are a group of cardiovascular anomalies involving the outflow tracts and great vessels
    ([8] (Weerakkody, 2022)) . A study ([6] (Hutt et al., 2005)) compares female mice’s body weights with and without exposure to cigarette smoke. The mice were exposed in whole body inhalation exposure chambers for 30 
    months; 5 days a week from the age of 6 weeks. The results show a significantly less mean body weight for the mice exposed to the cigarette smoke compared to the mice that had no exposure. This can be used to prove
    the correlation of smoking and low birth weights in pregnancy.

   Despite these facts, on average statistics show that in the years 2021/2022, 9.5% of women were smoking at the time of delivery ([4] (Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), 2021)) . Even if the mother doesn’t smoke,
   second hand smoking is still able to occur. For example, paternal smoking can still have an effect as the mother is still inhaling harmful chemicals which is then passed onto the baby.  See table 1 below for 
   summary of statistics regarding impact of smoking.

   Quitting smoking for 9 months may be quite challenging but it benefits both mother and child. Nicotine replacement therapy is an alternative to help quit smoking during pregnancy. Absorbing small amounts can
   help through cravings and greatly reduces the risks during pregnancy and NRT does not contain carbon monoxide or tar. ([16] (Ash, 2021)) .  NRT can help you successfully stop smoking in pregnancy and reduce the 
   risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, poor growth and development, birth defects, premature birth, birth complications and much more ([16] (Ash, 2021)). NRT comes in different forms such as patches, nicotine chewing
   gum and inhalators which helps reduce unpleasant withdrawal effects such as bad moods and cravings. It should help with quitting but if used for long term independence, you should consult your health care
   provider ([17] (American Cancer Society, 2021)).
